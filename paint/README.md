# Paint

For the final OCaml homework of CIS 120, we had to make the MS paint application. As part of this project, I implemented the ability to draw lines and ellipses by clicking and dragging, and the ability to draw a point or bunch of points by clicking. I also added a checkbox widget and a slider to change the thickness of the pen when drawing the shapes.
